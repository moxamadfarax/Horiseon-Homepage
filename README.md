# Horiseon Homepage

## Description

This challenge is to revamp prior code to make it easier to read, without changing the way the webpage looks.

- My motivation to do this challeneg was that I want good grades.
- The code I have reworked and added makes it easier for other developers to read and understand it.
- I learned how many different semantic elements there are.
